I have recently finding myself having to ssh from my Windows machine. Why get another client when as developer, I alreadly have Git Bash installed?
However, I encountered an issue trying to use sshpass, fortunely some good folks have created a way for use to do it. But finding that out took quit some doing,
so I'm hoping that by creating this repo with just the exe, I can save some people some headaches.

Installaion
-pre-requeist: Git Bash
-simple down the exe and place under the Git\mingw64\bin folder

Usage
-sshpass -p 'password' -ssh username@sever
